# Remote MCP Server with OpenAPI Documentation

This project combines a remote MCP server with OpenAPI documentation, making it easy to explore and understand the available MCP tools.

## Integration Steps

To integrate the OpenAPI functionality into your existing remote-mcp-server:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --save @asteasolutions/zod-to-openapi swagger-ui
   npm install --save-dev @types/swagger-ui
   ```

2. Create a new file `src/openapi.ts` with the helper functions for OpenAPI integration.

3. Update your `src/index.ts` file with the changes to register and document your MCP tools.

Alternatively, you can run the provided installation script:
```bash
chmod +x install-openapi.sh
./install-openapi.sh
```

## Using the OpenAPI Documentation

After starting the server, you can access the OpenAPI documentation at:

```
http://localhost:8787/docs
```

This will display a Swagger UI interface that shows all available MCP tools, their parameters, and expected responses. You can:

1. Browse the available endpoints
2. See the required parameters and their types
3. Test the endpoints directly from the browser
4. Understand the response format

The documentation is automatically generated based on the registered MCP tools.

### Demo Tool: Text Analyzer

The integration comes with a demo text analysis tool that provides:
- Word count
- Character count
- Basic keyword extraction

You can use this as a template to create your own tools with proper OpenAPI documentation.

## API Schema

You can also access the raw OpenAPI schema at:

```
http://localhost:8787/openapi.json
```

This JSON file can be imported into API development tools like Postman or Insomnia.

## Development

When adding new MCP tools, make sure to document them in the OpenAPI registry in `src/index.ts` to keep the documentation in sync with the implementation.

## Deploy to Cloudflare

Follow the standard deployment process. The OpenAPI documentation will be available at your worker's URL:

```
https://your-worker.your-account.workers.dev/docs
```
